## Overview

This repository contains a theoretical framework introducing **Accessibility-Weighted Dynamics (AWD)** — a class of stochastic systems in which stationary occupation may be determined by transition accessibility rather than energetic ordering.

The work is divided into two clearly separated parts:

- **Part I — Mathematical Framework**  
  Formal development of transition accessibility, escape rates κ(ω), and the invariant measure  
  P_ss(ω) ∝ κ(ω).

- **Part II — Philosophical Appendix**  
  A speculative conceptual reflection inspired by the mathematical structure.  
  This section does not claim physical derivation and is presented as interpretation.

## Core Idea

In classical equilibrium statistical mechanics:

P(ω) ∝ exp(−βE(ω))

In Accessibility-Weighted Dynamics:

P_ss(ω) ∝ κ(ω)

where κ(ω) is the total outgoing transition rate (escape rate).

This shift replaces energetic depth with kinetic connectivity as the ordering principle of stationary occupation.
