## Overview

Accessibility-Weighted Dynamics (AWD) is a theoretical framework describing stochastic systems in which stationary occupation is determined by transition accessibility rather than energetic ordering.

---

## Core Principle

In classical equilibrium statistical mechanics:

P(ω) ∝ exp(-βE(ω))

In Accessibility-Weighted Dynamics:

P_ss(ω) ∝ κ(ω)

where κ(ω) is the total outgoing transition rate (escape rate).
